# dayspann beta testing guide

[English](BETA_TESTING.md) | [日本語](BETA_TESTING.ja.md)

Thank you for testing dayspann. You do not need to complete every check. Testing the parts closest to your normal workflow is already helpful.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is beta software. Start in a test vault or a backed-up vault. Before sharing screenshots, check that they do not contain private notes or personal information.

## Install with BRAT

1. Open **Settings → Community plugins** in Obsidian.
2. Turn off Restricted mode if it is enabled.
3. Select **Browse**, search for `BRAT`, then install and enable it.
4. Open the Command palette and run **BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing**.
5. Enter this repository:

   ```text
   shingotanaka0115/dayspann
   ```

6. Open **Settings → Community plugins** and enable **dayspann**.
7. Confirm that the dayspann version is `0.1.7` or later.
8. Open dayspann from its ribbon icon or run **Open list** from the Command palette.

## Update the beta

Run **BRAT: Plugins: Check for updates to all beta plugins and UPDATE** from the Command palette. If an old interface or behavior remains after updating, disable and re-enable dayspann or restart Obsidian.

## Finish testing

1. Disable dayspann under **Settings → Community plugins**.
2. Uninstall dayspann.
3. Remove dayspann from BRAT's managed beta plugins.

Uninstalling dayspann does not automatically delete the Markdown record files it created in your vault. Review and delete those files manually only if you no longer need them.
